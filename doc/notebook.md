# Lab Notebook

Use this file to document any important changes you've made or any records of running the system.

This notebook uses Markdown. Use '#' to create headings. When you make a change put the heading ### followed by the date and your name. Always add changes above previous changes. Leave these instructions on top. You can also use - to make a list of items and \[text\](link) to add a link.

#### Stuff that needs to be done on classifier:
- Tune hyperparamers
- Test on dev set
- Decide whether to add additional layers
- Print outputs to pretty graphs

#### Training RNN 
- Training with 768 hidden layers, BCELoss(), LR=0.005, epochs=5, results in the loss functions going down, but accuracy staying about the same. Getting accuracy scores hovering around 60%.

### 4-11 Hilly
- Read the ACL paper on shared task--they used BERT as a baseline.
- Found out that [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/classify_text_with_bert) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/hub/huggingface_pytorch-transformers/) have pre-built BERT models.

### 4-7 Hilly 

- Created lab notebook and created a data folder in the src directory.
- Tagged [deliverable 1](https://github.com/hasteinmetz/LING573-Project/releases/tag/D1).
