# Meeting notes

## 4-11

- Decided on a baseline task
  - RoBERTa
  - Use PyTorch since out of the box
  - Still room to add additional features and improve performance (e.g., punctuation frequencies)
  - Use provided tokenizer
  - Backup: Word2Vec embeddings and SVM
    - Date of pivot: Check if on the right track next Tuesday
- Splitting up work:
  - Split into 4 tasks to build RoBERTa model -- first do some research
  - Maybe split it up so that 2 people write the program, 1 person writes the report, and one person does research
- Workflow:
  - Work on a branch with the name "alias/purpose" for now
  - Regroup later on
  - Staging branch for development and main is for deliverable tagging

### Action items

- Go through a tutorial
  - Think about how it can be split
  - Think about interoperability
- Make back on Thursday to talk about how to split up work
